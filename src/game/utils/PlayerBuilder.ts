/**
 * QUANTUM JUMPER - PLAYER BUILDER
 *
 * This builder class makes it super easy to create and configure player characters
 * using simple, readable code. The player is the main character that the user controls.
 *
 * WHAT IS A PLAYER?
 * The player is the character you control with the keyboard. It can:
 * - Move left and right with arrow keys
 * - Jump with space bar or up arrow
 * - Collect coins for points
 * - Use powerups for special abilities
 * - Switch between light and dark dimensions with X key
 * - Die and respawn if it falls off the world or hits enemies
 *
 * FLUENT API EXAMPLE:
 * createPlayer(scene)
 *   .withLives(3)           // Start with 3 lives
 *   .withScore(0)           // Start with 0 points
 *   .atPosition(5, 10)      // Place at grid position (5, 10)
 *   .withSpeed(200)         // Move at 200 pixels per second
 *   .withJumpPower(800)     // Jump with 800 pixels/second upward velocity
 *   .build();               // Create the player!
 *
 * BEGINNER TIP: You can change the speed and jump power to make the game
 * easier (higher values) or harder (lower values) to control.
